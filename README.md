# EEE-485-Final-Project
The term project aims to analyze the founded data on  different machine learning algorithms. All machine learning algorithms gives result satisfied or not satisfied, which is binary classification. Machine learning algorithms planned to use in the term project are Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.
